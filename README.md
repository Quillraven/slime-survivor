# Slime Survivor

### Description

A very basic "Vampire Survivors" clone for a [LibGDX](https://libgdx.com/) tutorial on my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@Quillraven) channel.
It is meant to be like the "A simple game" tutorial of the official LibGDX wiki but more exciting.

The project demonstrates core LibGDX concepts including:
- **ShapeRenderer** for debug rendering
- **SpriteBatch** for texture rendering
- **Animations** for attack effects
- **Font rendering** with TrueType fonts
- **Input handling** for player movement
- **Audio** playback
- **Basic math** including rectangle overlapping and vector-based movement

### Controls

- **W / A / S / D** - Move player
- **R** - Restart game (when dead)
- **SPACE** - Start game (from controls screen)
